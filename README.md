# Iris-Flower-Species-Classification-using-Ensemble-Learning
In this project, we use the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). The dataset is preprocessed by removing the 'Id' column and encoding the 'Species' column using label encoding.
